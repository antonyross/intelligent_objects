# intelligent_objects
This is a workshop presented at the Recurse Center.

I will first demonstrate programming motion and autonomous behavior in objects. I will then introduce some machine learning (Reinforcement Learning) to show how objects are able to learn. I will be coding within  d3.js, but one could also follow along using p5.js. No knowledge of d3 is required but a vague understanding of object oriented programming would be helpful.
