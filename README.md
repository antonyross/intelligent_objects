# intelligent_objects
This is a workshop presented at the Recurse Center.

I will first demonstrate programming motion and autonomous behavior in objects. I will then introduce some machine learning to show how objects are able to learn. I will be coding within  d3.js, but one could also follow along using p5.js. No knowledge of d3 is required but a vague understanding of object oriented programming would be helpful.

While walking to Recurse Center one day, I observed how those walking on the street share a cadence of avoiding each other just enough to continue moving toward wherever it is that they're going. Some have a larger radius of avoidance than others but they all (almost always) avoid bumping tnto each other. I decided to see if I could train an autonomous agent to, similarly, learn to avoid bumping into all other autonomous agents, but just enough so as to not significantly alter wherever the agent is trying to go. This is demonstrated using Reinforcement Learning, first in python, and then visually in d3.
